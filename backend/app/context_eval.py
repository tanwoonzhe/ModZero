"""
Context analysis for access attempts.

This module provides a simple risk assessment based on the IP address
and time of access.  The heuristic awards more points for requests
originating from private networks during typical business hours.  It
returns both a context score and the detected client IP.  Future
enhancements could include GeoIP lookups, user behavior patterns, or
integration with Azure AD sign-in risk signals.
